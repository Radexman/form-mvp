### Prisma 7 + Neon PostgreSQL Setup — completed 2026-08-28

Phase 1 database foundation. Prisma 7.10.0 (pinned exact) wired to Neon Postgres, the full domain schema, and a hot-reload-safe client singleton. Merged to `main` as `ba3b6bd`.

**Delivered**

- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `User`, `Subscription`, `UsagePeriod`, `Apiary`, `Hive`, `Inspection`, `PdfGenerationJob`, `AiReport`, plus Auth.js `Account` / `Session` / `VerificationToken`; five enums; cascade deletes down the user → apiary → hive → inspection → pdf job chain; `@@index([hiveId, inspectedAt])` and friends.
- `prisma.config.ts` — v7 config, loads `.env.local` explicitly so the CLI and Next.js share one env file; prefers `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` for migrations when set.
- `app/lib/prisma.ts` — `PrismaClient` through the `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter behind a dev-safe global singleton.
- Migration `20260828141044_init` applied to the Neon **development** branch (`br-old-bonus-b1yjip8c`). Production branch untouched.
- Scripts: `db:migrate`, `db:deploy`, `db:studio`, and `postinstall` → `prisma generate`.

**Decisions worth remembering**

- **It's Prisma 7, not 8.** The spec was titled "Prisma 8" but every requirement in it described Prisma 7 — and `@prisma/client` has no 8.x release at all (the `8.0.0-rc` exists only for the CLI package). Prisma 8 is a rewritten ORM: no `PrismaClient`, no driver adapters, contract-based schemas, TS graph migrations, and no published Neon or Vercel guidance. Prisma's own docs still call 7 the right choice for production.
- **`@prisma/adapter-pg`, not `adapter-neon`** — direct TCP against Neon's *pooled* endpoint. Neon's pooler does the real pooling, so each serverless instance keeps `max: 5`. Revisit only if edge runtime is needed.
- **`connectionTimeoutMillis: 10_000` is explicit.** Driver adapters inherit node-postgres' default of `0` (never time out), unlike pre-v7 Prisma's 5s — a half-open socket would otherwise hang a request forever, the exact field-connectivity failure this phase exists to fix.
- **`sslmode=verify-full`, never `require`.** node-postgres treats them identically today, but pg v9 switches `require` to libpq semantics that skip certificate verification. Use `verify-full` in Vercel's production variable too.
- **`Hive.currentInspectionId` is `onDelete: SetNull`** — deleting an inspection must not delete the hive. Forms a two-table FK cycle with `Inspection.hive`, which Postgres permits.
- **Auth.js fields stay snake_case** (`refresh_token`, …) — `@auth/prisma-adapter` binds to those column names.
- **Client output is `generated/prisma` at the repo root**, not `src/generated/prisma`; this repo has no `src/`. Gitignored, rebuilt by `postinstall`.
- **`vitest.config.mts` aliases `@` to the project root.** Vite ignores tsconfig `paths`, so any suite importing the Prisma singleton failed to resolve the generated client.

**Verified:** full `User → Apiary → Hive → Inspection → PdfGenerationJob` round trip against the live dev branch (JSON section columns, derived scalars, the denormalized pointer, the indexed history query, and cascade deletes), plus TLS certificate validation via `socket.authorized`. `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `vitest run` (189 tests) and `next build` all green.

**Left open:** `DATABASE_URL` for the Neon **production** branch still needs adding to the Vercel project settings before the first deploy.

**Follow-ups noted, not done:** `context/coding-standards.md` still carries a stale Sanity/monorepo section and assumes a `src/` directory this repo doesn't have.
